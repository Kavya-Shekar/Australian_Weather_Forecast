Data analysis of weather in Australia
 
Temp vs month  
-> Temperature is gradually increasing over the years.
-> Could be a sign of global warming.

Rainfall vs month  
-> Rainfall has dropped disastrously over years.  
-> Rainfall minimum in Sydney during June-July  

Combinations:  
(Temp vs month) and (Rainfall vs month) and (Humidity vs month)   
-> Note that Rainfall is minimum in those months when temperature is minimum and vice versa  
   Hence temperature is directly proportional to amount of rainfall. Makes sense since humidity increases with temperature, thus rain increases
