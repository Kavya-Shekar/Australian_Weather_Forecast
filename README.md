Data analysis of weather in Australia

Kavya  
1. (Done) Max Temp vs month for 3 different years (global warming increasing or decreasing)  


Sonam  
1. (Done) Rain vs month for 3 different years (and inferring how rain is increasing or decreasing) and conclusions about that   
2. Temperature changes on one day. And comparing them for different months (say January and December)
3. Humidity vs month    


Conclusions:  
Temp vs month  
-> Temperature is more or less  constant over the years.  
-> (Please add conclusions about global warming etc)  

Rainfall vs month  
-> Rainfall has dropped disastrously over years.  
-> Rainfall minimum in Sydney during June-July  

Combinations:
(Temp vs month) and (Rainfall vs month)  
-> Note that Rainfall is minimum in those months when temperature is minimum and vice versa  
   Hence temperature is directly proportional to amount of rainfall, makes sense since humidity increases with temperature (??), thus rain increases (have to plot humidity vs month to check)
